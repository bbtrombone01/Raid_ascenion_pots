            Hello this is a tool for the game “Raid Shadow Legends”, focused on the ascension mechanic. I have found it hard to know what resources are needed to gain ascension levels, due to a lack of transparency and shifting needs as you acquire new champions. In order to address this, I created a tool to allow players to enter information about their ascension needs. As you fill out the form bellow, this tool provides a count of all ascension material needed.
