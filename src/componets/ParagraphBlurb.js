             Hello this is an app for the game Raid Shadow Legends, focused on the
             ascension mechanic. While playing the game  i have found it hard to plan 
             gaining ascensions levels due to a lack of in game transperancy and 
             shifting needs due to acquirng new champions as you play.
             In order to adress this i created this app to allow players to enter key information about their 
             ascension needs. As you fill out the form bellow you this app provides
             all the resources you need for the required levels of ascension. 

        </p>
